# WhyMaker Internal Chatbot

The WhyMaker AI chatbot provides instant, intelligent answers to questions about WhyMaker by searching through our internal knowledge base and generating contextual responses.

## üéØ Purpose

This chatbot serves as WhyMaker's internal AI assistant, helping team members and users quickly find information from our documentation, policies, procedures, and other company resources. It's designed to reduce the time spent searching through documents and provide consistent, accurate answers.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### **Knowledge Base**
- **Source**: Company documents stored in Google Drive
- **Content**: Product documentation, policies, procedures, FAQs, and other internal resources
- **Updates**: Automatically syncs with Drive folder changes (indexed daily)

### **Search & Retrieval**
- **Technology**: Google Cloud Vertex AI Search (Enterprise Search)
- **Process**: When you ask a question, the system semantically searches through all indexed documents
- **Intelligence**: Finds relevant information even when your question doesn't use exact keywords from the documents

### **Answer Generation**
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT (configurable between Fast and Smart modes)
- **Context**: Uses the most relevant document snippets as context for generating answers
- **Accuracy**: Responses are grounded in actual company documents, not general AI knowledge

### **Interface**
- **Platform**: Modern web interface accessible via browser
- **Features**: Real-time chat, conversation history, source citations
- **Access**: Available at `chatbot.whymaker.com` (or internal Vercel URL)
