# Overview (For Everyone)

This guide explains, in plain language, what the WhyMaker Chatbot is, what problems it solves, and how you can use it.

## What it is
- A website where you can ask questions and get answers based on WhyMaker’s documents and knowledge.
- It combines Google’s search over our documents with OpenAI to write clear answers.
- It’s designed so non‑technical staff can quickly find accurate information without digging through folders.

## What you can do with it
- Ask questions about policies, procedures, programs, trainings, products, and internal materials.
- Upload a file (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, image) and ask questions about that file.
- Get short summaries, bullet points, lists of action items, or a draft paragraph.
- Continue the conversation: ask follow‑ups and the chatbot remembers the chat context.

## What it will not do
- It won’t browse the entire internet for answers; it focuses on WhyMaker’s information first.
- It won’t change or delete your files.
- It won’t save uploaded files permanently; uploads are used only to answer your question.

## Where to use it
- Web link: provided by your team (for example, `https://chatbot.whymaker.com`).
- Works best on a laptop/desktop browser. Mobile works too for quick questions.

## Who maintains it
- Hosted on Vercel (cloud website hosting).
- Uses Google services (Drive and Vertex AI Search) to find relevant information.
- Uses OpenAI to write clear, readable answers.

## Tips for great results
- Be specific: include names, dates, topics, or document titles.
- If the answer feels general, add context (e.g., “Focus on the Welcome Packet slide deck”).
- When uploading, keep files under a few megabytes; use the Smart model for richer answers.
