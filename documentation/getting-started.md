# Using the WhyMaker Chatbot (Getting Started)

This guide shows how to use the chatbot day‑to‑day without any technical steps.

## Open the chatbot
- Visit the link (for example, `https://chatbot.whymaker.com`).
- Add it to your bookmarks for quick access.

## Sign in (if asked)
- Use your WhyMaker Google account (info@whymaker.com or your work account).
- If you see a message about a “redirect URI,” that simply means the sign‑in link is being checked for security—continue the sign‑in.

## Ask a question
- Click in the message box, type your question, and press Send.
- Be specific: add names, dates, or topics (e.g., “Refund policy for workshops in 2024”).
- You can ask follow‑up questions in the same chat; the chatbot remembers the conversation.

## Upload a file (optional)
- Click the + button to attach a PDF, Word document, PowerPoint, or image screenshot.
- After attaching, ask a question about the file (e.g., “Summarize slide 5,” “List action items mentioned in this doc”).
- Tip: The Smart model works best with files and images.

## Choose a model
- Fast: quick, short answers. Good for simple questions.
- Smart: more accurate, longer answers, understands files/images better.
- The app will switch to Smart automatically when you attach files.

## Understand the answer
- The response blends information from our documents and your uploaded files.
- If you need more detail, ask “show bullet points” or “cite the source.”

## Good habits
- Keep uploads under a few megabytes so they process quickly.
- For important decisions, skim the original document.
- If something seems off, ask a follow‑up like “recheck using the Welcome Packet doc.”
